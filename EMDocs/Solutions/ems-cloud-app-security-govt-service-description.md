# Microsoft Cloud App Security Government service description

## How to use this service description

The Microsoft Cloud App Security US Government service description is designed to serve as an overview of the service offering in the GCC High environment and will cover feature variations from the commercial offering.

To learn more about Microsoft Cloud App Security for GCC customers, see [EMS for US Microsoft 365 GCC customers](./ems-govt-service-description.md#ems-for-us-gcc-high-and-dod-customers).

## Getting started with Microsoft Cloud App Security for US Government GCC High

The Microsoft Cloud App Security GCC High offering is built on the Microsoft Azure Government Cloud and is designed to inter-operate with Microsoft 365 GCC High. Full details on the service and how to use it can be found in the [Microsoft Cloud App Security public documentation](/cloud-app-security/). The public documentation should be used as a starting point for deploying and operating the service and the following Service Description details and changes from functionality or features in the GCC High environment.

To get started, utilize the [Basic Setup](/cloud-app-security/general-setup) page for access to the Microsoft Cloud App Security GCC High portal, and ensure your [Network requirements](/cloud-app-security/network-requirements) are configured. Follow the additional steps in the How-to guides for other detailed instructions.

## Feature variations in Microsoft Cloud App Security GCC High

Unless otherwise specified, new feature releases, including preview features, documented in [What's new with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/release-notes), will be available in GCC High within three months of release in the Microsoft Cloud App Security commercial environment, unless otherwise noted.
