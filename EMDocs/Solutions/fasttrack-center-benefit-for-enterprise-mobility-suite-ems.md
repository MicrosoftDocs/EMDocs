# FastTrack Center Benefit Eligible Services and Plans
You can use the service benefit when you purchase at least 150 licenses for Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) or any of its individual cloud services in an eligible plan. With the service benefit, you can work with Microsoft specialists to assess, remediate, and enable eligible services.

To learn about the FastTrack Center process and who's responsible for what, see [FastTrack Center Benefit Process for Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)](fasttrack-center-benefit-process-for-enterprise-mobility-suite-ems.md).

## Eligible services
If you purchase any of the following Microsoft online services through an eligible plan, Microsoft helps you onboard to them and then tries to contact you to offer onboarding assistance. You can also request assistance from the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) if you are ready to deploy these services for your organization. To request assistance, sign in to the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/), go to the dashboard, expand the **Need Help?** at the left of the screen, and then follow the prompts to complete your request. Once onboarding support starts, we’ll set up a schedule of online meetings.

Customers can opt in to the onboarding process once per each eligible Microsoft online service.
