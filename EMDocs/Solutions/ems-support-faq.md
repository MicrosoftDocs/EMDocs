# Enterprise Mobility + Security Support FAQs
Microsoft provides global pre-sales, billing, subscription, and technical support for Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS). Administrators can request support through the  [Office 365 portal](https://portal.office.com/Default.aspx?SkipSspr=true) or by contacting  [Office 365 Support](https://support.office.com/article/Contact-Office-365-for-business-support-32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b?CorrelationId=c1f4c670-18b3-41ec-81c9-e8d383caa6ad).

## Answers to common EMS support questions

**Do I need to purchase an Azure support plan to submit an Enterprise Mobility + Security support request?**

Support is included with Enterprise Mobility + Security. You can submit support requests for Azure Active Directory Premium, Azure Information Protection, and Microsoft Intune through the Office 365 portal. The Office 365 portal provides the intended support experience for EMS, but you can also submit Azure Active Directory Premium and Azure Information Protection support requests through the Azure portal without purchasing a support plan by choosing a *Subscription with technical support included*.

**How do I get Intune support?**

Enterprise Mobility + Security customers can submit support requests for Intune using the  Office 365 portal. [Learn more about  Intune support options](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/troubleshoot/how-to-get-support-for-microsoft-intune).

Go to  Office 365 Support to find the support phone number for your region.

**How do I get support with Volume Licensing, Volume Licensing Online Service Activation, or if I need to have the activation email resent?**

Contact  Microsoft Volume Licensing Support for support with these issues.

 **If I purchased my Enterprise Mobility + Security licenses through a Microsoft partner, should I contact them for support?**

Yes, your Microsoft partner should be able to provide you with support directly. Contact your Microsoft partner first to understand the level of support they can provide.

**I previously owned Intune but renewed my Enterprise Agreement with Enterprise Mobility + Security licenses. How do I handle license management?**

Go to the  Azure portal for license assignment. Please follow the instructions in your welcome email to manage your new Enterprise Mobility + Security licenses.
