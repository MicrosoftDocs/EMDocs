# FastTrack Center Benefit Process for Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)
If your organization is eligible for the FastTrack Center Benefit for EMS, you can work remotely with Microsoft specialists to get Microsoft Azure Active Directory Premium and Microsoft Intune ready for use. You can also request help through the [FastTrack site](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/ems) for Azure Information Protection, Microsoft Cloud App Security and Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics. To learn whether your organization is eligible, see [FastTrack Center Benefit Eligible Services and Plans](fasttrack-center-benefit-for-enterprise-mobility-suite-ems.md).

-   Licensed users can access EMS Services by using one of the following identity options:

    -   Cloud Identities (unique EMS accounts).

    -   Synchronized Identities: EMS accounts synchronized from your on-premises Active Directory by using the Azure Active Directory Connect tool. This option is for customers with a single forest or multiple Active Directory forests.

    -   Federated Identities--with Microsoft EMS accounts that are:

        -   Synchronized from Active Directory with the Azure AD Connect tool. This option is for customers with a single Active Directory forest configuration.

        -   Federated with Windows Server 2012 R2 Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 2.0 or later from your on-premises Active Directory.
