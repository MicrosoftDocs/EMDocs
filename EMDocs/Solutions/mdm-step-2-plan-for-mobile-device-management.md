Managing mobile devices, both company-owned and user-owned, encompasses several important lifecycle management decisions. After you’ve determined the mobile device platform, application, and user requirements for your organization, you’ll also need to identify how to manage each of these areas in a way that aligns your overall MDM strategy with other management and support policies. In this step, we’ll examine the MDM enrollment, management, monitoring, and reporting lifecycle requirements.
