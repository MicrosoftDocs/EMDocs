# Enterprise Mobility FastTrack Program
You use the Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) FastTrack Center Benefit when you purchase at least 150 licenses for EMS or any of its individual cloud services in an eligible plan. You then work with Microsoft specialists to assess, remediate, enable, and drive usage of those services. These specialists also provide migration guidance. 

To learn more about eligible services and plans, see [FastTrack Center Benefit Eligible Services and Plans](fasttrack-center-benefit-for-enterprise-mobility-suite-ems.md).

To learn about the FastTrack Center process and who’s responsible for what, see [FastTrack Center Benefit Process for Enterprise Mobility + Security](fasttrack-center-benefit-process-for-enterprise-mobility-suite-ems.md).
